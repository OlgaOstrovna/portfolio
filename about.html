    <main>

      <p>Here I would like to provide you with the main details of my project workflow. </p>
     
      <p>Time spent: <b>30 hours.</b></p>
      
      <p>Tools used for the creation of this website: <b>NinjaMock, Sublime, Command Prompt, Browser-sync, Google Browser.</b></p>

      <p>Difficulties: <b>Since I am a newcomer to the field of programming it took me some time and effort to understand the programming approach and to look for solutions for all the challenges.</b></p>

      <p>My first step was thinking and developing an idea for my future website. At this stage, this is crucial to visualize the idea as a layout. For doing this I used a nice resource NinjaMock.</p>
      <p>I decided to create 3 pages:
      <p><b>1. “About”</b> - brief description of the website and it’s idea.</p>
      <p><b>2. “Projects”</b> - some information about each of my projects with photos and links.</p>
      <p><b>3. “About the Portfolio”</b> - contains information about the framework and all the main steps of the website creation.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> since the main task of this assignment was the creation of a simple website, this portfolio website can be advanced and developed as well as the information it contains.</p>

      <p>I will introduce my further work in main steps providing a brief description together with screenshots.</p>

      <p>Connecting project folder with browser server using Command Prompt in order to conduct the updates on the website after each editing in Sublime automatically.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/01_browser.jpg" alt="command_prompt" /> 
      </figure>

      <p>Starting coding the main structure of the website with Sublime.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/01_Sublime_start.jpg" alt="Sublime" />
      </figure>

      <p>Using Lorem Ipsum as a generator of typographic layout in order to plan and organize the page space.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/02_lorem.jpg" alt="lorem" />
      </figure>

      <p>Embedding a picture to the Home page as well as embedding the background picture. The background picture is static, means it does not move during scrolling down through the page.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/03_image_home.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Creation of a CSS file in order to set up the design like fonts, colours etc.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/05_css.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>


      <p>Setup of a centre position of the picture and text in order to have a proportional allocation of each element.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/04_text&image_center.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Setup of the function for navigation (navigation panel/toolbar) - “header”.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/01_Sublime_start.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Setup of the work and access to social media links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn) - “footer”.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/07_footer.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Connection between all the pages for an acces to each page with navigtion panel.</p>

      <p>Creation of a project.html file in order to store there all the information about my projects (“Projects” page).</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/09_project.html.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Creation of cards - simple div elements (images+information)</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/cards.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Since I wanted modal windows appear by clicking on each card I used javascript code that was suggested on w3school.</p>

      <figure class="floatright">
      <img class="mainimg" src="/images/script.jpg" alt="picture" />
      </figure>

      <p>Thus, this task was both challenging and very interesting for me at the same time. It was a good dive into programming for me. Definitely, I have faced some problems and questions, but the process of googling helped me find the solutions.</p>

      <p>So now you are very welcome to my portfolio website!</p>
      <p><b>Enjoy! :)<b></p>
